### Key Benefits

#### For Pet Owners

- Track pet grooming history and special instructions
- Automated reminders and notifications

#### For Groomers

- Digital schedule management with calendar view

In today's fast-paced world, everyone is busy doing something. Caring for a pet means having to send them for regular grooming appointments. However, most groomers require you to contact them via WhatsApp in order to book appointments. This creates unnecessary friction in what should be a straightforward process.
Pet owners must interrupt their day to send messages, wait for responses, and negotiate available time slots through back-and-forth conversations. This outdated booking method wastes valuable time for both pet owners and groomers alike.
Wouldn't it be great to be able to simply login and book an available time slot to send your pet for grooming? A digital solution that displays real-time availability, eliminating communication lag time and reduce scheduling errors would give owners the convenience of managing their appointments around their own schedule.
This would also be a benefit to groomers looking to digitize and streamline their daily operations, by providing an overview of their daily, weekly and monthly appointments at a glance. Gain valuable business insights by identifying peak hours and available slots, reducing double booking and scheduling errors that lead to unsatisfied customers and lost sales. With a digital appointment scheduling system, your resource planning capabilities become more effective: allocate staff better, plan assistant coverage, maximize use of grooming stations, bathing areas and drying equipment.

## Service Structure

- **Service Types as Appointment Properties**:

  - Basic Grooming: 60 minutes duration
  - Full Grooming: 120 minutes duration
  - Selected at the time of booking as a property of the appointment

- **Groomer Availability**:
  - All groomers provide both basic and full grooming services
  - All groomers are available from during business hours by default (Weekdays: 11am - 8pm, Weekends: 10am - 7pm)
  - Groomer able to use time block feature to set their recurring off hours (lunch, maintenance etc)

## Appointment Rules

- **Creation**:

  - Only pet owners can create bookings
  - System must check for existing appointments to avoid conflicts
  - Subject to groomer's available timeslots
  - Owners receive confirmation upon successful booking, notification emails sent to both parties (owner and groomer)

- **Updates**:

  - Only allowed more than 24 hours before the appointment
  - Subject to groomer's available timeslots
  - Updates by owners are reflected on the groomer's dashboard and notification emails sent to both parties (owner and groomer)

- **Cancellation**:

  - Only allowed more than 24 hours before the appointment
  - Cancellations by owners are reflected on the groomer's dashboard - current business logic had reducing friction with regard to users making appointments, but it may make more sense for cancellations to be updated as a status for appointments (soft delete)

- **Status Types**:
  - Confirmed
  - Completed

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Payment processing integration (perhaps by collecting a booking fee with the rest payable upon completion, may deter users though)
- Customer reviews and ratings
- Advanced reporting and analytics (CRM for groomers, add value to their business)
- Groomers able to send a service completion notification email to users with before and after pictures
- SMS notifications (super useful for a booking service but twilio free trial requires numbers to be verified)
