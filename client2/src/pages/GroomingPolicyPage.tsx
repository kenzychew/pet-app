      content: 'We are unable to provide a precise grooming price for your pet without a personal assessment. Grooming rates primarily depend on factors such as breed, size, the specific grooming services requested, and desired styling. Prices are based on Standard Size. For oversized pet, prices are charged differently. All grooming does not include de-matting or cutting of knots.\n\nFor returning customers, the grooming price will typically remain the same as your previous grooming appointment, unless we advise otherwise.'

      title: 'Promptness for Appointments',
      content: 'We kindly request that you arrive punctually for your pet scheduled appointment to ensure that all our valued pets can receive our services promptly. We acknowledge that life can present unforeseen circumstances, which is why we offer a 10-minute grace period for late arrivals in case of unexpected delays. If you anticipate being late, please contact us in advance so that we can make necessary adjustments to our schedule. It\'s important to note that if you exceed the grace period, we will treat your pet appointment as a walk-in and place her on our waiting list for the next available opening.'

      title: 'Cat Grooming',
      content: 'Cat grooming requires a gentle approach. We prioritize your cat\'s comfort and safety, and we do not use sedation during the grooming process. However, if your cat is uneasy with unfamiliar handling, uncomfortable with bathing or the sound of a hair dryer, or displays scratching or biting behavior, we may be unable to proceed with grooming.\n\nOur commitment is to ensure grooming remains an enjoyable experience for your cat. We also avoid any actions that may cause harm to your cat or our groomers. Therefore, we reserve the right to decline grooming services for cats that exhibit the mentioned behaviors.'
